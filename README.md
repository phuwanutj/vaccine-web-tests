## Which is better for E2E testing of web applications or web services? Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit?
In my personal opinion, the robot framework is a better choice because it is a lot easier to use and it is more flexible.

I found this website to be the most useful to me because it list the keyword one by one and explain what each one do and what argument to use with the keyword.
